#### Question

Use a for loop to iterate through all numbers up to 100; Print each number as follows:

  - if the number is divisible by 3 (i%3 === 0), print "ping"
  - if the number is divisible by 5 (i%5 === 0), print "pong"
  - if the number is divisible by 3 AND by 5, print "pingpong"
  - else just print the number

  ```
