##### Cipher

Make Sally encode some messages for you. The bot should:

- [] takes some text as input from the console;
- [] parses the text letter by letter;
- [] converts each letter to another letter according to the Cipher Rule;
- [] prints out the encrypted text;

###### The Cipher Rule

Each letter gets shifted to the right by 3 places. As a result, 'a' becomes 'd', 'e' becomes 'h'. The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: 'x' becomes 'a', 'y' becomes 'b' and 'z' becomes 'c'. Non-letter characters are not modified.



**Example Input**

```
> hi i am paul
```

**Example Output**

```
kl l dp sdxo
```
