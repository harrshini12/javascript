Maya wants to help you keep track of your social media consumption

Let's have Maya keep track of the following: the number of minutes that the user has spent online each day, for the last 5 days.

Maya can then compute some statistics for us.

The bot should:

  - [ ] declare an array of numbers
  - [ ] print the array of numbers
  - [ ] Print the average time spent on social media (in minutes)
  - [ ] Print the maximum time spent in a day (in minutes)
  - [ ] Print the minimum time spent in a day (in minutes)
  - [ ] Print the total amount of time spent on social media (in minutes)
  - [ ] All of the above, but in hours


  **Example Output**
  ```
  This is the time you spent on social media in the last 5 days:
  [40, 30, 20, 45, 15]

  The average time is: 35 minutes.

  The maximum time spent in a day is: 45 minutes.
